A C++ Driven spellcasting architecture project using Unreal Engine’s GAS framework, along with integration of core Gameplay Systems.

This project explores how Unreal Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS) can streamline the development of character abilities and improve game design workflows, all while leveraging C++ for the code architecture. Inspired by Hogwarts Legacy, the project implements a spellcasting system using GAS, featuring basic and special spells, defense, healing, mana, and health mechanics. By utilizing GAS, the system allows for greater modularity and easier management of complex gameplay features.

The goal is to create a scalable and flexible gameplay framework by separating various gameplay systems and applying design patterns that enhance both organization and modularity. The architecture is fully built using C++, ensuring high performance and maintainability. Additionally, the system integrates seamlessly with other key gameplay components, such as locomotion, UI, and visual effects, demonstrating how GAS can unify different aspects of the game in an efficient, coordinated manner.

Through this approach, the project showcases how Unreal Engine’s GAS simplifies the creation of complex systems, making them more organized, modular, and easier to develop and scale. This results in a flexible, high-performance architecture that can adapt to future feature expansions or adjustments.
